<p>Please note that you can create mailboxes for connected domains only.
    Use the following pop and smtp parameters to connect mailboxes to mail clients:
    <br><b>mail.connecting.name</b> — server for receiving mail
    <br><b>smtp1.connecting.name</b> — sending mail</p>
<p><b>
        In order to avoid unwanted mass newsletters, the mail sending is allowed only via ahnames mail server by
        default. Access to the port 25 to the other hosts is denied. If this port is required for your services, please,
        create a ticket with the corresponding request and a description of purpose of usage. After that the port will
        be open and this restriction will be removed for your VPS.
