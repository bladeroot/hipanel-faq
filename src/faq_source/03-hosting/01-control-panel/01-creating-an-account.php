<p>When account is created, youâ€™ll see a notification indicating successful completion of the operation and account
    directory will be created in the /home folder.</p>

<p>Use the name of the account as login to login via FTP and SSH. Access to account is limited to all IP addresses by
    default.
    This is done to protect your account. You need to indicate IP addresses that may have access to your account. To do
    so, click on the
    checkbox near the necessary account and click on "Allowed IPs" in the action bar.</p>
