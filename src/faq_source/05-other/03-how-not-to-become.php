<h4>5 rules: "How not to become a fraud victim when buying a domain"</h4>
<p>Anyone who delves into domain business a bit deeper than everyone else knows about the existence of the secondary
    market of domain names.
    Today this market is full of offers for various likes and tastes, starting with great and expensive domains and
    ending with trashy names
    that cost a couple of bucks. Of course, this market couldn’t have stayed ignored by fraudsters who are looking for
    enrichment possibilities
    at expense of others. </p>
<p>There are countless auctions and platforms that are protected. But practice shows that many customers disregard the
    safety rules to speed up
    the transaction, thus becoming fraud victims. Others don’t even know about the safety rules and because of that
    trust hackers with their safety and money.
    While we can’t give you advice on how to overcome greediness and impatience, we highly recommend following few
    simple rules that will ensure the safety
    of your domains and money.</p>

<h5>Rule #1: Check the seller</h5>
<p>Since all of the transactions take place in Internet, it is important to know who you’re dealing with.
    During the first contact with the seller, find out his nickname and ICQ number at forums. After you have gathered
    this information,
    use Google to learn more about seller’s transaction history. It is important to understand that if your seller has a
    recently created
    profile and poor transaction history, you probably should not work with him. The old account of this seller may have
    too many negative
    reviews from people that he fooled.</p>

<h5>Rule #2: Make sure that the seller owns the domain</h5>
<p>It’s funny how many times people buy stolen domains that are claimed by their real owners after the money is already
    paid.
    In every case the buyer has no one to blame but himself. Avoiding this type of fraud is simple. The only thing you
    have to do
    is ask the seller to upload a confirmation file to the website. This may be a photo or a text document with random
    content.
    It is also advised to check if the seller’s information matches the Whois data. If Whois protect is activated, ask
    the seller
    to turn it off while you check his personal information.</p>

<h5>Rule #3: Know who you pay</h5>
<p>Since WebMoney transactions have become a usual thing for CIS citizens, the first thing to pay attention to is the BL
    of seller’s wallet.
    Think twice or even cancel the transaction if your seller has a low BL level and a certificate that is lower than
    personal.
    It is possible that seller’s old wallet has negative reviews, similar to the first rule.</p>

<h5>Rule #4: Use Escrow</h5>
<p>If you are new to domain business and have no experience in purchasing or selling domains, you can use the
    Escrow service that is a secure third party that ensures the safety of your money. Don’t skimp on few cents that
    will go to
    Escrow while risking to lose all the money from your transaction.</p>

<h5>Rule #5: Reissue the rights to domain</h5>
<p>When buying a domain your desire to receive it asap is understandable, but it is important to remember that it is not
    enough
    to Push the domain to become its rightful owner. Without changing owner’s information you simply get the ability to
    control the domain.
    That is why the transmitting party needs to officially transfer the rights to domain using the registrar’s guide.
    Only after that you’ll
    become the rightful owner of a domain name.</p>
