        You register a .XXX domain name as an individual or a company with an accredited registrar, and you pay the
        registration fees directly to the registrar.
    </li>
    <li>
        ICM Registry will send an introductory email to the email address you provided your registrar. If you used a
        privacy protection service we will send the email to the email address associated with your privacy service (so
        make sure to check).
    </li>
    <li>
        Click on the Membership Application button within the introductory email that was sent by ICM Registry. This
        will take you to the Sponsored Community Membership Application.
    </li>
    <li>
        Complete the Membership Application. The application process takes approximately three minutes and is free of
        charge. Please note the Membership Application only needs to be completed one time per email account, not per
        domain registration.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Membership Application requires the applicant to attest to the following information:
        <ul>
            <li>Address</li>
            <li>Valid Date of Birth</li>
            <li>Valid Email</li>
            <li>Valid Phone Number</li>
            <li>Agree to ICM's Registry-Registrant Agreement</li>
            <li>Attest to being a member of the Sponsored Community</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the Membership Application is complete, you will receive an email from ICM Registry with your Membership
        Token. You need to provide this token to your registrar so that each .XXX domain you have registered can be
        associated with the token. .XXX domains that are not associated with a Membership Token will not resolve to a
        live website so it is important for you to complete this final step.
    </li>
    <li>
        Please save the Membership Token email for future reference. You will need to apply this token to all websites
        before they can be activated.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you misplace your Membership Token, you will need to contact customer support and provide the email address
        associated with your application.
    </li>
